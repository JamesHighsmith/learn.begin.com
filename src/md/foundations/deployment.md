# Deployment

There are currently three ways to deploy an Architect app to AWS:

- Begin.com
- Architect CLI
- AWS SAM or CloudFormation CLI

## Deploy with Architect

Architect deploys to a `staging` stack by default, will generate and cleanup all the required JSON, YAML and deployment bucket ceremony for you.

```bash
arc deploy
```

To manually deploy to a production stack run `arc deploy production`. 

> Protip: there are many other options for Architect deploymentâ€¦it is a deployment tool!

## Deploy with Begin

If you've created an app using [Begin.com](https://begin.com) all you need to do is commit to master!

```bash
git push origin master
```

Git tags deploy to production.

```bash
npm version patch 
git push origin master
```

## Deploy with SAM

Running `arc package` generates SAM/CloudFormation `sam.json` which can then be deployed by AWS SAM or AWS CLI tools.

```bash
arc package

sam package \
  --template-file sam.json \
  --output-template-file out.yaml \
  --s3-bucket [S3 bucket] \

sam deploy 
  --template-file out.yaml \
  --stack-name [Stack Name] \ 
  --s3-bucket [S3 bucket] \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM,CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND \
  --region [AWS_REGION]
```
> Note: s3-bucket, stack-name and region parameters are required
