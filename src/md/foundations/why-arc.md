# Why choose OpenJS Architect

- Developer experience tuned for building serverless web applications
- Curated subset of free tier serverless primitives from AWS without the vendor specific configuration 
- Front end development workflows are seamless
- Open source, open governance, great cadence, no breaking changes, mature and well tested
- Solid, helpful and growing community
- Deployments are standard AWS SAM and CloudFormation (eject and bail to vanilla SAM anytime or stay high level)

## Compare

- K8s/Docker: containers are not serverless when the smallest unit of compute is running a literal web server
- Terraform: wide support for older monolithic architectures and, while possible, serverless is not a first class citizen missing things like local development workflows
- Serverless, mature tool with wide support to many platforms and capabilities but without deep support for web use cases; things like local development are an after thought
