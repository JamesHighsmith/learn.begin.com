# Why choose OpenJS Architect

- Tuned for building serverless web applications
- front end development workflows are seamless
- Open source, open governance, great cadence, no breaking changes, mature and well tested
- Solid, helpful and growing community
- Deployments are standard AWS SAM and CloudFormation (eject and bail to vanilla SAM anytime or stay high level)

## Compare

- K8s/Docker: despite the marketing is not serverless if the smallest unit of compute is a literal web server
- Terraform: wide support for older monolithic architectures and, while possible, serverless is not a first class citizen missing things like local development workflows
- Serverless, mature tool with wide support to many platforms and capabilities but without deep support for web use cases; things like local development are an after thought
